# Detection of Peripheral Blood Cell Images using Deep Learning

## Some method that I might do
- Analyse blood cells dataset: Examine image quality, gain insight of the dataset through data visualization methods.
- Address imbalance dataset: Apply data augmentation methods, generative image technique Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), Generative - Adversarial Networks (GANs).
- Deep learning method: Detect and classify blood cells using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as YOLO, VGG19,... or some attention mechanism like Vision transformer.
- Evaluation and Validation: Evaluating models performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, â€¦


## Objective that I should done
- Identify and quantify class imbalances.
- Implement basic data augmentation and generative image technique.
- Train functional CNN models then compare them with evaluated metrics.
